### Update: I will be purusing a Masters of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [UCLA](https://ucla.edu)!!!

### I am fourth year ⚡ Electrical Engineering Undergraduate at UC Irvine, specializing in Digital Signal Processing. To accelerate my studies, I have vehemently taken a graduate course in 📷 [Digital Image Processing](https://catalogue.uci.edu/allcourses/eecs/) and am apart of the [Accelerated Status](https://engineering.uci.edu/admissions/graduate/accelerated-status-program) program for the ECE Master's Degree. 

### I am currently an undergraduate student researcher for the 💻 [Irvine Computer Vision Laboratory](https://newport.eecs.uci.edu/~timothd4/ICVL) at UC Irvine under the direction of Professor [Glenn Healey](https://engineering.uci.edu/users/glenn-healey). We are doing research on Spectral Image Filtering on 🔥 Wildfires. In the industry, I have interned at [Western Digital](https://www.westerndigital.com/) as an 🌐 Industrial IOT intern for the Summer of 2022.

### I have a wide array of 🧑‍💻 programming assests such as MATLAB for Image Processing, Python for Data Analytics/Tensorflow AI, Java for Android App development, and C for Embedded IoT Systems. I also have 👨‍🔬 hardware experience in Osciilloscopes, Spectrum Analyzers, and Multimeters.

### Philanthropically, I hace contributed back to the community with my work with the 🏕️ BSA and 🎺 [Evergreen Music Mentors](https://timothydo.me/evergreenmusicmentors). I also like to work on my [HomeLab](http://timothydo.me/thedolab) during my Free Time. I come up with pretty cool circuits & IoT projects to make my Work From Home setup much more productive! Please check out [TheDoLab's](https://timothydo.me/thedolab) self hosted website when you're free!
 
### Please reach out by any means for collaborating on projects to make the world a better place 🌍!
