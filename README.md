### I am a Computer Vision Engineering Intern at [SiMa.ai](https://sima.ai)! I graduated this past June with an M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at [UCLA](https://ucla.edu), cocentraing in Signals and Systems! I focused on Hyperspectral Imaging, Machine Vision with Neural Networks, and Image Processsing Acceleration during my curriculum.

### I  was an undergraduate student researcher for the 💻 [Irvine Computer Vision Laboratory](https://newport.eecs.uci.edu/~timothd4/ICVL) at UC Irvine under the direction of Professor [Glenn Healey](https://engineering.uci.edu/users/glenn-healey). I conducted research on Spectral Image Analysis on 🔥 Wildfires. In the industry, I am currently an Embedded Software Engineering intern at [Maxeon Solar](https://maxeon.com/) and have interned at [Western Digital](https://www.westerndigital.com/) as an 🌐 Industrial IOT intern for the Summer of 2022.

### I have a wide array of 🧑‍💻 programming assests such as MATLAB for Image Processing, Python for Data Analytics/Tensorflow AI, Java for Android App development, and C for Embedded IoT Systems. I also have 👨‍🔬 hardware experience in Osciilloscopes, Spectrum Analyzers, and Multimeters.

### Philanthropically, I hace contributed back to the community with my work with the 🏕️ BSA and 🎺 [Evergreen Music Mentors](https://timothydo.me/evergreenmusicmentors). I also like to work on my [HomeLab](http://timothydo.me/thedolab) during my Free Time. I come up with pretty cool circuits & IoT projects to make my Work From Home setup much more productive! Please check out [TheDoLab's](https://timothydo.me/thedolab) self hosted website when you're free!
 
### Please reach out by any means for collaborating on projects to make the world a better place 🌍!
