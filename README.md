## Greetings, Fellow Internet Explorer! 😎

<img width="60%" src="https://timothydo.me/images/cory.jpg">

### My name is Timothy Do, and I am fourth year Electrical Engineering Undergraduate at UC Irvine, specializing in Digital Signal Processing. To accelerate my studies, I have taken a graduate course in [Digital Image Processing](https://catalogue.uci.edu/allcourses/eecs/) and am apart of the [Accelerated Status](https://engineering.uci.edu/admissions/graduate/accelerated-status-program) program for the ECE Master's Degree. 

### 📄 Here's My [Resume](https://timothydo.me/resume.html)

### I am currently conducting research for the [Irvine Computer Vision Laboratory](https://newport.eecs.uci.edu/~timothd4/ICVL) at UC Irvine under the direction of Professor [Glenn Healey](https://engineering.uci.edu/users/glenn-healey). We are doing research on Spectral Image Filtering on Wildfires.

### I interned at [Western Digital](https://www.westerndigital.com/) as an Industrial IOT intern for the Summer of 2022!

### I have a wide array of programming assests such as MATLAB for Image Processing, Python for Data Analytics/Tensorflow AI, Java for Android App development, and C for Embedded IoT Systems.

### My research interests include image processing algorithms combined with artificial intelligence in the form of neural networks. I took part in a [research project](https://github.com/dotimothy/EECS195-Colorization) focusing on the different methodologies to colorize images with AI.

### I also like to work on my [HomeLab](http://timothydo.me/thedolab) during my Free Time. I come up with pretty cool circuits & IoT projects to make my Work From Home setup much more productive! Please check out TheDoLab's self hosted website when you're free!
 
### Please reach out by any means for collaborating on projects to make the world a better place!

### What I Do
🔭 I am a big fan of working with Raspberry Pis 🍓. I just recently made an [LED Temperature Sensor](https://github.com/dotimothy/picoTemp) using the Raspberry Pi Pico's internal sensor. I'm also learning GPIO programming on the Raspberry Pi, where I made a [Morse Code Transmitter](https://github.com/dotimothy/PiFmMorse) by concatenating sound files with Python, then transmitting it with PWM.
<br>
🌱 I’m currently learning Python in the Wake of the Artificial Intelligence Industry.
<br>
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything that involves enchancing media.
<br>
🤔 I’m looking for help with learning server languages, like SQL, Django, or AWS.
