### What I Do
🔭 I am a big fan of working with Raspberry Pis 🍓. I just recently made an [LED Temperature Sensor](https://github.com/dotimothy/picoTemp) using the Raspberry Pi Pico's internal sensor. I'm also learning GPIO programming on the Raspberry Pi, where I made a [Morse Code Transmitter](https://github.com/dotimothy/PiFmMorse) by concatenating sound files with Python, then transmitting it with PWM.
<br>
🌱 I’m currently learning Python in the Wake of the Artificial Intelligence Industry.
<br>
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything that involves enchancing media.
<br>
🤔 I’m looking for help with learning server languages, like SQL, Django, or AWS.
